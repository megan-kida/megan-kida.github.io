<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Where Am I?</h2>
<p>Englewood, Colorado</p>
<h2>Academia</h2>
<h3>Why LIS?</h3>
<p>Long story short is before my dad died he told me to always look for a better job no matter how good your job is. The only exception is if I can find a job reading books all day that pays me $100,000 a year. I know librarianship does not totally fit that description, but it will make me happy while also paying the bills.</p>
<p>The less sappy part of that story is I have had an endgoal for my career since I was 16 and everything I have done since has been planning on how I can get there. Getting my MLIS degree is one of those steps.</p>
